Each record is unique and immutable and every record (except the first) contains a reference to the record that came before it.

Every record has a [[hash]] that identifies the record and ensures that any changes to it are detected.

Every device thatâ€™s a part of this network contains a copy of the database, and multiple devices have to agree that a record is valid using a consensus mechanism before it can be added to the database.
