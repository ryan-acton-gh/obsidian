Not just simply what is the book about?

The main events of the `story` (actions) devised and the connected order in which these events occur.
### How is it not a story?

According to [[E.M Forster]]:
	Story:
		"The king died and then the queen died"
	Plot:
		"The king died and then the queen died of grief"

In a plot there is a clear causation. Y happens because of X -> they are connected


```THEREFORE and not AND THEN```

A good way to visualise how events happen in a story is [[Freytag's Pyramid]]

### How Plot Works in Harry Potter?

Illustrated using [[Freytag's Pyramid]]

The [[Freytag's Pyramid#Exposition|Exposition]] is when we are introduced to Harry and the Dursleys. We learn that he is a mistreated orphan and letters are delivered to the house before his 11th birthday. And for the [[Freytag's Pyramid#Inciting Incident|Inciting Incident]] finally Hagrid hand-delivers his Hogwarts acceptance letter and informs Harry that he is a wizard.

For the [[Freytag's Pyramid#Rising Action|Rising Action]] Harry learns what it means to be a wizard and discovers the world. He meets some supporters and antagonists, Snape and Malfoy. He faces the standard new student school year problems, which involve mysterious occurrences. Harry and his friends reach the conclusion that Snape is trying to steal the Philosopher's stone and he battles through the puzzles to get to it.

For the [[Freytag's Pyramid#Climax|Climax]] he reaches the stone and finds professor Quirrell, not Snape. Quirrell reveals that he tried to kill Harry at a quidditch match and that he is possessed by Lord Voldemort who tries to take the stone from Harry who then passes out.

Harry then wakes up later to find that Quirrell could not take the stone as part of the [[Freytag's Pyramid#Falling Action|Falling Action]] and that Voldemort left Quirrell to die and that the stone was destroyed.

[[Freytag's Pyramid#Resolution|Resolution]] is the conclusion of the school year when his friends win back the house points they lost earlier and Gryffindor win the house cup.

[[Freytag's Pyramid#Denouement|Denouement]] is when Harry returns to the Dursley's, not informing them that he can't use magic outside of school.
### Character + Action = Plot

##### The role of Characters
[[John Gardner]], once said there are only two plots in all of literature: someone goes on a journey and a stranger comes to town.

[[Hayao Miyazaki]] said that what drives animation is the will of the characters. You don't depict fate, you depict will.

#### A supplement to Bloom's course on character
The key questions for character creation:
1. [[What do Great Characters Want|What do they want?]]
3. [[What are Great Character Weaknesses|What are their weaknesses?]]
4. [[Where do Great Characters Come From|Where are they From?]]
5. [[Where do Great Characters Go|Where do they go?]]
6. [[How do Great Characters Surprise You|What can they do to surprise?]]

#### A simple way of conveying plot/Pitch
When an inciting incident happens to character,Â 
they have to overcome conflict slash obstacles, to complete quest.
