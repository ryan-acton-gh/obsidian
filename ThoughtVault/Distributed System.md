"Set of cooperating computers that are communicating with each other over a network"

```
If you are designing a system that can be solved on a single computer it is preferable.
```

People build these systems to achieve [[parallelism]], to be [[fault tolerant]] or because a problem is naturally [[spread out in space physically]] or for [[security]] reasons to achieve isolation.

These systems are challenging because they can have [[partial failures]], involve [[concurrency]] and require careful design to achieve good performance.

Common Distributed System architectures that we aim to abstract are: [[Storage]], [[Communications]] and [[Computations]]

### Tools for Abstraction
1. Implementation
	1. [[Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)]]
	2. [[Threads]]
	3. [[Concurrency Controls]]
2. Performance
	1. [[Scalability]]
	2.
