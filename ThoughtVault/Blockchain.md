A blockchain is a digital record of transactions distributed and shared among the nodes of a computer network. Each transaction in the blockchain is called a [[Block]] and links to another with cryptography techniques.

*It is a special kind of [[Distributed Database]]*

Useful when building systems that require decentralisation on a large scale, data to be unchangeable once added to the system or require transparency and integrity of the system data.
