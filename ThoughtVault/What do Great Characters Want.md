All great characters want something

[[Kurt Vonnegut]] author of Slaughterhouse Five wrote that the first step in writing a great story is creating a character that wants something. Even if it was simply a drink of water.

#### Desire is crucial in creating believability for readers. This is different from a character that needs something.

"A character that needs something is fate. A character that wants something is will."
